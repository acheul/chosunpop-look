# *Look on Chosun-Population and Social Mobility Studies*

*Chosun dynasty(Korea, 15th~19th Century)* produced the triennial population census data, called *HoJeokDaeJang*. Today only parts of the original data remain, still considerable is the amount. This historical big data - easily covering more than 200 years and 2 million population size - has triggered interesting studies of demography and social sciences.

This project, ***ChosunPop***, seeks to take a leap to dive into the data with more powerful methodological tools and statistical frameworks. Let's say, HOW to quantitatively estimates social status of individuals from the raw records which have qualitative formats? HOW to conduct a statistical analysis on this massive but messy data that left behind history?

These methodological HOW questions directly link to some theoretically important questions of modern days social science. HOW to describe and categorize shapes of social stratification and social mobility? HOW mobility engages in inequality and vice versa? WHAT is the long-term dynamics of the social mobility and social inequality? Modern day researchers are still waiting for long-term and abundant dataset to answer these questsion. Here is *HoJeokDaeJang*, remains of Korean ancien regime, which is long-term and informatically abundant - but still messy and intricate to handle.

The ChosunPop project struggles to handle it. Via Machine Learning and Bayesian framworks. ML helps to quantitatate qualitative formated data: i.e., creating social status score from raw records. ML(DL) also helps to build modles to investigate longitudinal connection between individuals and households. Connecting records longitudinally (for example, connects 1810's records *Kim* and 1819's records *Kim*) enables new research surfers: we can check inter-generational social/spatial mobility - during the super-long-term period!

Bayesian frameworks help to handle the data which is incomplete and messy in its nature comparison to modern day survey data. Analyses and inferences on the data demand a series of subjective assumptions: which are expected to be explicitly combined with the statistical model, not implicitly. The bayesian hierarchical modeling enables to handle it.

At this moment, this project produces one organized [paper](https://snu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/1fgjt92/82SNU_INST51868062750002591) (not in journal, a dissertation). The future schedule of development is not tightly planned for now, but the proposed combination of the data and methodological approaches of this project is ready to trigger any further development arount the fields.

This repository mainly covers look-able assets from the studies, rather than codes to produce the assets.
